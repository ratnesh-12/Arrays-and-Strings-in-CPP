# Experiment - 7
# 1. Check if a string is a palindrome
# Aim:
To check whether a given string is a palindrome using C++.
# Theory:
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., madam, racecar). To verify this, we reverse the string and compare it with the original.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully checks and displays whether the given string is a palindrome.
# Algorithm:
1.Start

2.Take a string as input

3.Reverse the string

4.Compare the reversed string with the original

5.If both are same, it's a palindrome

6.Else, it's not a palindrome

7.End
# 2. Concatenation of two strings
# Aim:
To concatenate (combine) two strings in C++.
# Theory:
String concatenation is the process of joining two strings into one. In C++, we can use + operator or append() function to achieve this.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully concatenates two user-input strings and displays the result.
#  3. Input and output of array elements
# Aim:
To take input for elements of an array and display them using C++.
# Theory:
Arrays in C++ are used to store multiple values of the same type. Using loops, we can input and output elements efficiently.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully takes input from the user and displays the array elements.
# 4. Find maximum and minimum element in an array
# Aim:
To find the largest and smallest elements in a given array using C++.
# Theory:
We can iterate through the array using loops and update the maximum and minimum variables by comparing each element.
# Conclusion:
The program correctly finds and displays the maximum and minimum elements from the array.
# Algorithm:
1.Start

2.Input size and elements of the array

3.Initialize max and min with the first element

4.Traverse the array

5.If current element > max, update max

6.If current element < min, update min

7.Display max and min

8.End
# 5. Reversing an array
# Aim:
To reverse the order of elements in an array using C++.
# Theory:
Array reversal means swapping the first element with the last, the second with second-last, and so on. This can be done using a loop till the middle of the array.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully reverses the array and displays the result.
# 6. Search an element in an array
# Aim:
To search for a specific element in a given array using C++.
# Theory:
We perform a linear search by iterating through each element and checking if it matches the target value.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully finds and displays the position of the searched element, if present.
# Algorithm:
1.Start

2.Input array size and elements

3.Input the element to search

4.Traverse the array

5.If element found, display index and stop

6.If not found till end, show not found message

7.End
# 7. String input and displaying it
# Aim:
To take a string input from the user and display it.
# Theory:
In C++, strings can be taken using cin or getline(). Display is done using cout.
# Conclusion:
The program takes a string input and displays it successfully.
# 8. Display string in reverse order
# Aim:
To display a string in reverse order using C++.
# Theory:
We can reverse a string using loops, or with built-in reverse() function, by printing characters from end to start.
# Conclusion:
The program displays the string in reverse order correctly.
# Algorithm:
1.Start

2.Input the string

3.Use a loop to iterate from the last character to the first

4.Display each character

5.End
# 9. Find sum and average of array elements
# Aim:
To calculate the sum and average of all elements in an array using C++.
# Theory:
By adding all elements of the array using a loop and dividing by the number of elements, we can find the average.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully calculates and displays the sum and average of the array.
# Algorithm:
1.Start

2.Input array size and elements

3.Initialize sum = 0

4.Traverse array and add elements to sum

5.Calculate average = sum / size

6.Display sum and average

7.End
