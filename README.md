# Experiment - 7
# 1. Check if a string is a palindrome
# Aim:
To check whether a given string is a palindrome using C++.
# Theory:
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., madam, racecar). To verify this, we reverse the string and compare it with the original.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully checks and displays whether the given string is a palindrome.
# Algorithm:
1.Start
2.Take a string as input
3.Reverse the string
4.Compare the reversed string with the original
5.If both are same, it's a palindrome
6.Else, it's not a palindrome
7.End
