# Experiment - 7
# 1. Check if a string is a palindrome
# Aim:
To check whether a given string is a palindrome using C++.
# Theory:
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., madam, racecar). To verify this, we reverse the string and compare it with the original.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully checks and displays whether the given string is a palindrome.
# Algorithm:
1.Start

2.Take a string as input

3.Reverse the string

4.Compare the reversed string with the original

5.If both are same, it's a palindrome

6.Else, it's not a palindrome

7.End
# 2. Concatenation of two strings
# Aim:
To concatenate (combine) two strings in C++.
# Theory:
String concatenation is the process of joining two strings into one. In C++, we can use + operator or append() function to achieve this.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully concatenates two user-input strings and displays the result.
#  3. Input and output of array elements
# Aim:
To take input for elements of an array and display them using C++.
# Theory:
Arrays in C++ are used to store multiple values of the same type. Using loops, we can input and output elements efficiently.
# Conclusion:
The program successfully takes input from the user and displays the array elements
